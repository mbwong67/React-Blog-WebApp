# React-Blog-WebApp
Due to the ongoing pandemic, people are forced to isolate themselves at home. Because of this, social interactions with other people have become more difficult.
In order to revive social interactions with other people, we have decided to make a blogging site, where users can create an account with which they can interact with other people on our platform. 
Users can create their own blogs which they can modify to be either public or private. When the blogs are public, other users will be able to see them and respond with a like or a dislike.

## Installation
Enter the /express/express-backend folder and run the command
`npm i`
then 
`npm start`
to run the express backend

Enter the React/project folder and run the command
`npm i`
then
`npm start`
